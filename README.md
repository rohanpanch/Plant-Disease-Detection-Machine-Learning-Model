# Plant-Disease-Detection-Machine-Learning-Model
This work introduces an innovative approach to combating plant diseases, a persistent threat to global agriculture and domestic gardening, through the use of deep learning technologies. I investigated the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the automatic detection and classification of plant diseases using digital images of plant leaves. I trained the CNN model on a curated dataset consisting of thousands of images categorised into healthy and various diseased states.

The method proved partially successful; I achieved high accuracy in identifying common plant diseases, outperforming traditional visual inspection methods significantly. This success demonstrates the potential of machine learning in transforming disease management practices by providing rapid, accurate diagnostics accessible to both commercial farmers and home gardeners. The developed web interface further supports this accessibility, enabling users to easily upload images for diagnosis, thus facilitating early detection and potentially reducing crop loss.

The study's findings suggest that with further refinement and expansion of the dataset to include a wider range of diseases and plant species, this approach could be universally applicable, offering a scalable solution to one of agriculture's most pressing challenges.
